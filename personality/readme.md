# Personality Prediction Model

This directory contains the code and dataset along with requirements to build this model and predict personality types (introvert or extrovert) based on various features.

- This model is based on machine learning supervised classification techniques.
- The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
- KNeighbors Classifier is used for classification.
- Common data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling are applied.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `dataset.csv`. It contains various features that can be used to classify personality types.

## Running the Model

To run the personality prediction model, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Visualization

If you wants to visualize the data, you can use matplotlib or seaborn to create plots. Currently, the visualization code is not included in the main script.
