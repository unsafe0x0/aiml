# House Value Prediction Model

This directory contains the code and dataset along with requirements to build this model and predict house values based on various features.

- This model is based on machine learning supervised regression techniques.
- The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
- Polynomial Regression is used for prediction.
- Common data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values are applied.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is expected to be `dataset.csv`. It should contain various features that can be used to predict house values.

## Running the Model

To run the house value prediction model, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Visualization

If you wants to visualize the data, you can use matplotlib or seaborn to create plots. Currently, the visualization code is not included in the main script.
